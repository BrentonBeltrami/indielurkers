## This is a website to allow creators to attempt to get invite codes to the indiehackers website.

There is an issue of indiehacker members having too many invite codes & people that want to join the community not having a reasonable way to get in.
I am victim to this issue & I set out to solve it by creating a website that allows users to create posts explaining why they deserve to get into the community & other users vote on the most deserving to increase visibility.
